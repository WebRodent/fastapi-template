# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As we stride towards fostering a transparent, collaborative, and inclusive environment, we—the contributors and maintainers—commit to ensuring that everyone's participation in our project and community is respectful and free from harassment, regardless of individual attributes like age, physical attributes, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, religious beliefs, or sexual identity.

## Expected Behaviors

To maintain a nurturing environment, we encourage:

- Adopting welcoming and inclusive terminology
- Respecting diverse viewpoints and experiences
- Receiving constructive feedback gracefully
- Prioritizing the community's overall well-being
- Demonstrating empathy and understanding to fellow members

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Use of sexualized language, imagery, or any form of unwarranted sexual attention
- Engaging in trolling, derogatory remarks, or any form of personal or political attack
- Any form of harassment, be it public or private
- Disclosing someone's private details, like physical or email addresses, without their clear consent
- Engaging in any behavior that's deemed unprofessional or inappropriate

## Our Role

It's the duty of project maintainers to elucidate the expected behaviors and they are entrusted to take just and timely actions against any breach of this code.

Maintainers hold the prerogative to modify, remove, or reject comments, commits, edits, issues, and other contributions that aren't in sync with this Code of Conduct. They also reserve the right to temporarily or permanently exclude any contributor for behaviors that are perceived as harmful, offensive, or threatening.

## Applicability

This Code of Conduct holds in all realms associated with the project, whether internal or public, especially when an individual acts as a representative of the project or its community. Official emails, social media posts, and formal representations in events, both online and offline, are some scenarios where one might represent the project.

## Addressing Violations

Should you encounter any behavior that contradicts this code, please report it to the project team at postmaster@webrodent.com. Each report will undergo a thorough investigation, leading to a judicious response fitting the situation. Confidentiality of the reporter will always be a priority. Specific enforcement policies, if any, will be declared separately.

Maintainers who fail to uphold this Code of Conduct earnestly may face sanctions as decided by the project's leadership body.
